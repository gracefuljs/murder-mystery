# Murder Mystery

Just a quick little game written in Javascript, or at least the prototype for it anyway. It will soon be used to play with <a href="http://www.live2d.com/en/">Live2d's</a> SDK for Javascript.

For now, it will be a rudimentary spot the liar type of game with a simple, procedurally generated mystery. Character traits and personalities will also be procedually generated, but their appearances will be hard-coded for the time being. The game will be rendered via Pixi.js and will feature full-motion, original Live2d models.

Notes will be tracked in the Wiki tab.
